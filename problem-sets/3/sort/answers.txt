sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: 
- slowest algorithm with O(N^2) runtime complexity -> has slowest runtimes



sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?:
- fastest algorithm with O(NLogN) runtime complexity -> has fastest runtimes



sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?:
- medium fastest algorithm due to:
    - process of elimination
    - having O(N^2) runtime complexity
- has medium runtimes between `sort2` and `sort1`

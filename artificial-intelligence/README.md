## Notes

- video timestamp: TODO
- generative artificial intelligence
- prompt engineering = asking good questions to an AI chatbot
- system prompt
    - e.g.
        ```
        You are a friendly and supportive AI ...
        ```
- user prompt
- chat.py
- Copilot
- artificial intelligence
- decision trees
- machine learning
- reinforcement learning
- explore vs. exploit
    - explore -> randomness?
- supervised learning
- unsupervised learning
- deep learning = doesn't involve human intervention
- neural networks
    - based on human biology
    - `ax + by + c > 0`
- large language models
- generative pre-trained transformers (GPT)
- hallucinations 
- example games that AI can play
    - pong videogame
    - tic-tac-toe
        - minimax algorithm
    - chess
    - breakout

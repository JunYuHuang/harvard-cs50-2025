## Notes

- at video timestamp 1:19:09
- in C programming language:
    - don't use `==` equality comparison operator to compare strings
    - use `strcmp()` function from `string.h` header for comparing 2 strings
    - create `structures` i.e., `struts` as a data structure
        - like the precursor to classes in OOP
    - dot `.` operator to access members in a struct
- data structure = container for multiple data types
    - create `structures` i.e., `struts`
- sorting
    - sorting algorithms
        - selection sort
        - bubble sort
        - merge sort
- recursion
- binary search
